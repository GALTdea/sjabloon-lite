# Sjabloon LITE (for Rails 6)

_Sjabloon LITE_ is a basic and slimmed-down version of Sjabloon: a Rails 6 SaaS starter kit to focus on your core product right from the start.

_Sjabloon LITE_ provides you with a starting point for your new Rails app with modern front-end tools:

- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [PostCss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss)
- [StimulusJS](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus)

It adds and configures these tools (eg. Tailwind + [PurgeCss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss)) for you. By removing Sprockets (`--skip-sprockets`), including the `app/assets` directory, your new app is well organised and ready for the future. âœ¨
